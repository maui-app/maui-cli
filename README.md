### Maui CLI

------------
Cli tool for one of my applications. [Maui](https://mauii.app "Maui") (React frontend + Laravel GraphQL API). It does essentially everything Maui does but via the command line. My original intention was to build it and publish as a package to PyPi but after completing it locally, I've been too lazy/too busy with work/too busy with other projects to get that done. Hopefully I can find time to publish it soon.

Its written in Python via the [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/ "Typer") CLI framework.
